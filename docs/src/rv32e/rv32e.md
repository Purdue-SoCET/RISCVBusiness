# RV32E Base ISA
The RV32E base ISA is identical to the RV32I base, except the number of integer registers is halved; that is,
instructions may only use x0 - x15. x0 is still a hardwired 0 register, so RV32E provides 15 GPRs. Encodings
using x16-x31 are specified as *reserved* encodings.

## Implementation
The RV32E implementation simply adds a parameter bit to the file `standard_core/rv32i_reg_file.sv` to control
the number of integer registers available. 

As the specification notes, the behavior of decoding a reserved encoding is "UNSPECIFIED". For most instructions
in this RISC-V core, reserved encodings will cause a trap. However, for RV32E, the implementation cost of identifying
all reserved encodings is too high to do this. This is because it would require modifying the `control_unit.sv` and all
its sub-decoders to identify which instructions are making use of the registers (as, for example, an I-type instruction
could have an immediate field overlapping with the rs2 field). 

**Therefore, this RV32E implementation opts to treat register selectors x16 - x31 as *aliases* for x0-x15 (the top bit
of the register select is ignored entirely).** 

This should not cause a problem for normal software (as the compiler/assembler will not emit these instructions), 
but has the potential to complicate debugging as attempting to execute binaries compiled for RV32I, or incorrectly
executing a data region with data that appears to be encodings using x16 - x31 will cause silent failures.
