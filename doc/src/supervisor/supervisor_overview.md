# RISC-V Supervisor Extension Overview

## Introduction

This project aims to integrate the RISC-V "S" Supervisor Extension in to SoCET's RISC-V processor. This project implements the base extension as outlined in the privilege specification, along with a translation lookaside buffer (TLB), hardware page walker (PW), and a virtually indexed, physically tagged L1 cache (VIPT L1$) to with the goal of running an operating system on the processor.

## Background

Supervisors, also known as operating systems (OS), are privileged programs that interface between user-programs and the hardware it runs on. The RISC-V "S" Supervisor Extension
